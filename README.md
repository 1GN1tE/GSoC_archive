## Contribution:

If you have previously applied for GSoC, you might help build this repo by contributing the proposals you submitted or by sharing your experience in GSoC.

Sometimes, great proposals are rejected due to the,
- submission of an even better proposal,
- Limited slots given by GSoC to the orgs.
 
So, even if your proposals are rejected, please contribute them as well.

**If your proposal has been accepted, try to link the project announcement to the pull request.**
